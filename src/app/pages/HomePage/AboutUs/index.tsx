            <P>
              Hi! My name is Calixto, I'm a 17-year-old grade 12 graduate from
              North Toronto Collegiate Institute and am about to attend The
              University of Waterloo for Chemical engineering. I have played
              competitive soccer and gymnastics for over 10 years and have
              experience with other sports including basketball, track, and
              volleyball. I also have plenty of experience leading and coaching,
              including volunteering as a C.I.T. at Just Bounce Trampoline Club
              and, as an assistant coach for North York Academy, and of course
              the 3 years that I have previously run this camp. Finally, I am
              also a National level trampoline athlete competing for Just Bounce
              Trampoline Club.

          <MissionText>
            Camp Cali was created during the summer of 2020 as a way to return
            children to physical activity allowing them and their parents to lead
            a healthier lifestyle during the pandemic. Now, more than 4 years
            later, Camp Cali is still the fun, educational, multi-sport camp it
            started off as, however, with 4 more years of experience. Our mission
            as a camp is to teach kids the fundamentals of different sports and
            the importance of active living while simultaneously having lots of
            fun along the way. Our camp also prides itself to be able to cater to
            all aspiring young athletes whether they play sports recreationally or
            if they wish to take their athletic performance to the next level.
